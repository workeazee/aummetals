            Ceramic Products
          </div>
          <p class="home-slider__txt-about text-start p-3">
            As we were associated with various foundries and steel plants we started manufacturing various ceramic
            products required by these industries. All the products are are capable of heat resisting capacity of 1700Â°
            C.
            <br>
            <br>
            First, we started with the pouring cups required for the investment casting manufacturers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Along the way we saw the hardships faced by sand casting manufacturers in their fettling department. Thus,
            we developed the Ceramic Breaker Core which has made life of many foundries easy and happy. Various sizes of
            ceramic breaker cores are available as per the size of castings, grade of materials, etc.
            <br>
            <br>
            Going along with the steel plant industry, we developed ceramic tubes used by the thermocouple
            manufacturers. Various sizes are available and company specific requirements can be done as per need. We are
            also manufacturing ceramic tubes required for the electrical furnaces, etc.
